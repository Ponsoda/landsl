Title: Determining landslide probability
Description: This package contains different functions which final goal 
              is to determine the landslide danger in an specific area.    
              The package is taking elevation, aspect and slope as the main
              elements to calculate the probability by using INLA package.    
              Then this point probability is used to make a raster calculation.
